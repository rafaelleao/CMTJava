INSTALLATION/USAGE GUIDE FOR CMTJava
---------------------------------------

This distribution contains the following files:

compiler/								The CMTJAVA compilation tool's source files

src/
	test/									Test programs written in CMTJava
	stm/			

compile_samples.sh &		Scripts for compiling and running the sample programs
test_samples.sh

cmtjavac.jar						A read-to-use version of the CMTJAVA compilation tool


--------------------
1. REQUIRED SOFTWARE 
--------------------

 1. Sun's Java(TM) JDK (tested with Java 1.7 but should also work with Java 1.6)
 2. make
 3. BGGA closures (for using closures in Java)


-------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------

To work properly, the CMTJAVA compilation tool needs to find where the template file and the
closures folder are located.

    1) SET THE :  
       
			Set the CMTJAVAC environment variable with the path where the template file (CMTJava.stg)
			and the root folder of the BGGA closures files are. Both the template file and the
			closures folder are located in the "compiler" folder.
			Example (if you extracted the cmtjava package to the desktop): 
				export CMTJAVAC=~/Desktop/cmtjava/compiler/

---------------------------------
3. USAGE
---------------------------------

The usage of CMTJava is divided into two parts:

---------------------------------
3.1 TRANSFORMATION & COMPILATION
---------------------------------

  The CMTJava source files (.cmtjava) are first translated into Java + closures (.java) to be compiled with 
	the BGGA closures compiler. These files won't compile with the standard Java compiler.
	The translated files are generated in the same folder of the CMTJava source files.
	To generate then, the CMTJAVA compilation tool will look for the template file (CMTJava.stg) in the folder 
	$CMTJAVAC/CMTJava.stg

	After the translation, the .java files are compiled with the BGGA closures compiler. The CMTJAVA
	compilation tool will look for the BGGA compiler in the folder $CMTJAVAC/closures/bin/javac 

	For compiling the file called Foo.cmtjava, you need to type:
	$> java -jar cmtjavac.jar Foo.cmtjava

	You can also pass arguments to compiler.
	$> java -jar cmtjavac.jar -cp pathForClasses:. -d bin Foo.cmtjava


---------------------------------
3.1 EXECUTION
---------------------------------

To run the classes generated, just instantiante the Java virtual machine of the BGGA closures library. Example:
	$> $CMTJAVAC/closures/bin/java Foo

---------------------------------
4. COMPILE THE SAMPLE FILES
---------------------------------

In this package, there's a script to compile the sample files. 
To compile the sample data structures in CMTJava, just run the script "compile_samples.sh"
To test if the sample files are working, execute the "test_samples.sh" script
