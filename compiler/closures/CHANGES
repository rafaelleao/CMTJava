	Compiler crash on some closures that can't complete normally
	but which are assigned to a variable of a function type with a
	primitive result type.

2008-08-04

	Other nonlocal transfers now implemented.
	Transfers are now mostly transparent to catch clauses.

2008-08-02

	Nonlocal returns are now implemented.

	The "for" qualifier on methods is now preserved in the class
	file using a classfile attribute.  Previously the qualifier
	was only noticed by the compiler if the API is compiled from
	sources at the same time as its clients.

	Resolved some cases that would cause a failure to parse or a
	crash in semantic processing of eta expansion expressions in
	which the qualifying type has a wildcard argument.

	The closure conversion from an unrestricted closure to a
	restricted type doesn't exist.  It used to exist as a
	conversion but generate an error, which had unfortunate
	effects on overload resolution.

	Eta expressions produce restricted closures.

2008-07-05

	Eliminate most "capture of ? super" appearing in diagnostics.
	This improves many errors involving function types.

	Diagnotics involving closures now properly use => or ==>
	depending on how the closure itself was written.

	This version of the prototype is functionally equivalent to
	the previous version distributed on 2008-05-11, but unlike the
	previous version is now licensed under GPLv2.
