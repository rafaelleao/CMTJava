		CLOSURES FOR JAVA PROTOTYPE

This distribution includes what is needed to try out the prototype
Closures language feature for Java.  To use the prototype, you will
need to have an existing installation of JDK 1.5 or later on your
path.  Place the enclosed closures.jar on your VM's bootstrap
classpath when compiling using javac, and when running the resulting
programs.  Enclosed in the bin directory are some scripts that may be
helpful in doing that.

This is distributed entirely under the GPLv2 license, a copy of which
is enclosed.  The sources for this prototype were derived from
openjdk7, and appear in the mercurial forest that can be found at
